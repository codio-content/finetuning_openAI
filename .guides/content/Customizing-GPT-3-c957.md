One of the key endpoints that allows you to get the most of your GPT-3 model is the *fine-tuning endpoint*. By definition fine-tuning means adjusting precisely so as to bring to the highest level of performance or effectiveness. In other words, to adjust (something) so that it works perfectly. The fine-tuning endpoint allows you to customize the model to your particular use case. 

### Few-shot Learning 
------
 
OpenAI pre-trained GPT-3 with a prepared data set in a semi-supervised fashion. If given a prompt and a few examples it can most likely guess what task you are trying to perform and generate a completion based on that. This process is called **Few-shot Learning**. 

With fine-tuning one is able to  customize a model for your application. We can use our own data and create a model custom made for our different projects. Customizing makes GPT-3 more efficient and faster. Matter of fact, it even allows us to use cheaper models more efficiently.

### One-shot Learning
-------
One way to help with understand few-shot is learning about One-shot learning. **One-shot learning** is a concept in machine learning where a learning algorithm is capable of understanding information about an object, task, or event from a single instance or experience. The term "one-shot" comes from the idea that the machine only gets one "shot" or opportunity to learn about a concept. It's quite a challenging problem for machine learning, since typically, these algorithms depend on large quantities of data to accurately learn and generalize.

Humans are particularly good at one-shot learning. For example, if a child is shown a picture of a type of animal they've never seen before, say a pangolin, they can usually recognize it after seeing it just once. If the child is later shown a bunch of pictures of different animals, they can usually pick out the pangolin from the lineup. AI researchers hope to achieve this level of understanding and flexibility with machine learning algorithms.
